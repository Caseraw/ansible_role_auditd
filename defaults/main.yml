### Software packages required for installing auditd.
role_auditd_packages:
  - audit
  - audit-libs

### Auditd configuration file parameters.
## The configuration file is not set by default. Make sure to do your
## research and add what is required. Please don't just copy paste
## things you find on the internet. Understand the settings prior to
## using the settings. If unknown then just fall back to the original
## auditd configuration from the package.

# role_auditd_conf_file:
#   dest: /etc/audit/auditd.conf
#   src: auditd_conf.j2
#   owner: root
#   group: root
#   mode: '0640'
#   parameters:
#     - 'some meaningful configuration value'
#     - 'some meaningful configuration value'

### Managing auditd rules as files.
## Minimum required values: 'type', 'state' and 'dest'
##
## For better maintainability, the file list is built during runtime by
## combining all lists together. This will provide the freedom of declaring
## custom file lists for granular control. The lists require a naming
## convention by using a pattern. The pattern is rendered as a single list
## which can be used for iteration with variable: 'role_auditd_rules_file_list'
## The list name pattern needs to start with: 'role_auditd_rules_file_list_'
